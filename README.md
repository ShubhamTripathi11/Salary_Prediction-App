Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a simple Salary Prediction application that uses Linear Regression to estimate salaries based on years of experience. The model is trained on a dataset containing salary and experience data, and the predictions are displayed through a Streamlit web app.

It utilizes Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Streamlit for data processing, model training, and visualization. The trained model is saved as a .pkl file and integrated into the web app for real-time predictions. ðŸš€
